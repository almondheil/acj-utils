What needs to happen for this to be functional?

I want to provide a mechanism that lets you load up all the ids involved, and
then gives you comparisons to make based on those ids and the results of
comparisons so far.

You call some method that's just like

	ACJ(data, ...)

and it returns an object that's gonna let you do the stuff.

that object should be able to:
	get a script by its ID
	get the id of a script
